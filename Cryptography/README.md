Cryptography or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages ...

1. HASH
    Let's start with hashing.

    Identify the type of hash and find the plaintext password of the following hash

    b7a875fc1ea228b9061041b7cec4bd3c52ab3ce3

    Your flag for this mission is the plaintext password.

2. BRUTE FORCE
    Now things get a bit tougher.

    You have the hash value but we cannot breakit !

    Hash:  AAF8A6D56D4A0AB1E2D1D49329AB6956

    1 - Get the code (in the Launch button) that was used to generate this password hash (MD5.java)

    2 -  Your task is to find the plaintext from the hash
